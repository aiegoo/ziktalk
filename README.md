:100: You just scored the perfect point!! Congrats and thank you for visiting my site.

In addition to my PDF resume, I have created a resume site, first a static page like [here](pf1.36io.co), later I coded it in PHP, which should be dynamic with a db on a framework. But what you are going to see by following this [link](ziktalk.tonyleekorea.com) is my latest coding skill in Python. I love it and I believe this is the tool I will explore and master as if it's my second language.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

:prince: sincerely yours
